# QE Showcase Test PR

Welcome!

This repository is a take-home exercise for Quality Engineering (QE) candidates. The goal is **not** to grade you on correctness or to create a pass/fail test. Instead, we want to see how you approach real-world quality engineering problems, communicate your thought process, and use your favorite tools.

**Choose your own adventure:**  
Pick **one** of the following paths (see `/tasks/` for details):

- **Cypress**: Write an end-to-end test for a sample web app.
- **Postman**: Create an API test collection.
- **k6**: Script a basic load test.

**What we care about:**

- How you structure your code and tests
- Realistic assertions and thoughtful test cases
- Clear communication (in code, comments, and your PR)
- Basic Git usage (branch, commit, PR)

**What we _don’t_ care about:**

- Perfection or “the right answer”
- Full coverage or edge cases
- Build pipelines or automation

**How to proceed:**

1. Fork this repo.
2. Pick a task from `/tasks/` and follow the instructions.
3. Don't spend more than an hour on this.
4. Open a PR with your solution. Use the PR template to tell us about your approach.

We’ll leave comments and may ask questions — we’re interested in your reasoning and how you respond, not just what you build.

**Have fun, and thank you for sharing your process with us!**

- **k6** (load testing)
- **Newman** (run Postman collections from the command line)

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Run Cypress:**

- Open interactive UI:  
  `npm run cypress:open`
- Run headless:  
  `npm run cypress:run`

**Run k6:**

- `npm run k6`  
  (Edit the script path as needed)

**Run Newman:**

- `npm run newman`
