# What We're Looking For

When reviewing your submission, we'll focus on:

- **Structure:** Is your code/test organization clear and logical?
- **Assertions:** Are your checks realistic and meaningful?
- **Test Cases:** Did you cover the main flow and think about what matters most?
- **Communication:** Are your comments and commit messages clear?
- **Git Usage:** Did you use branches and commits effectively?

**Bonus points for:**

- Explaining tradeoffs or what you'd do with more time
- Using variables, data-driven tests, or custom commands (where relevant)
- Noting any bugs or oddities you found

**We're _not_ looking for:**

- 100% coverage
- Pixel-perfect code
- CI/CD or automation

**Remember:**  
This is a chance to show how you think, not a test to pass or fail!
